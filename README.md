# Simple Game

*Definition:*
In this capstone program we were asked to create a simple game in python using the pygame module.

## Aim

The aim of this project was to teach us how to install and use new modules for example the pygame module.

* Creating a game screen.
* Learning to load images to use in the pygame module.
* Setting boundries for each individual image.
* Setting the player, enemy and prize object starting positions.
* Assigning tasks to each arrow key for the player object to move. 
* Creating the basic game loop.
* Setting condition for losing and winning the game.

### Goal

moving from right to left. The player has to collide with the prize object without hitting any of the enemy objects in order to win*
